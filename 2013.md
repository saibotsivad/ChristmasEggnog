Often times we mix up the batch and do a taste test to see how it is. We might add whiskey or tequila for tha special back of he throat bite or cut with a little milk if it's coming on too string.

One batch makes aprox 1.75 liters.

The aclohol is up to you but we've had best luck using the following

Evan Williams or Ezra Brooks (nothin special really, just a little more smooth than Jack Daniels I think)
Vodka Monopoolwa - Potato Vodka is super smooth and realy compliments.
